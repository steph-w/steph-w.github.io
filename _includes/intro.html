    <p class="lead">Hi! I am a second year PhD student at Penn. I am grateful to be advised by Professor DanaÃ« Metaxa as a member of PennHCI. My research is supported by an AWS gift for research in Trustworthy AI. My work leverages tools from Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction and Computational Social Science to audit social computing systems.

      I returned to academia after working as a software engineer on personalized search infrastructure at Apple, and on scalable data analytics at Sisu Data. 
      
      Before that I studied Computer Science (MS) and Symbolic Systems (BS) at Stanford University.
