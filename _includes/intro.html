      <p>Hi! I am a second year PhD student at Penn. I am grateful to be advised by Professor <a href="https://metaxa.net/">DanaÃ« Metaxa</a> as a member of <a href="https://pennhci.com/">Penn HCI</a>. 
      My work is supported by an AWS gift for research in Trustworthy AI. </p>
      
      <p>My research utilizes machine learning, human-computer interaction and computational social science to audit social computing systems.</p>

      <p>I returned to academia after working as a software engineer on personalized search infrastructure at Apple, and on scalable data analytics at Sisu Data.</p> 
      
      <p>Before that I studied Computer Science (MS) and Symbolic Systems (BS) at Stanford University.</p>
