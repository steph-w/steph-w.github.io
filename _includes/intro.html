      <p >I'm a 3rd-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania in the <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/">Computer and Information Science</a> department. I am grateful to be advised by Professor <a href="https://metaxa.net/">Dana√© Metaxa</a> as a member of <a href="https://pennhci.com/">Penn HCI</a>.</p><br/>
      <p >My research draws from <b>Human-Computer Interaction</b> and <b>Computational Social Science</b> to design experiments and build systems that help us understand how algorithms and online content affect people, particularly in areas like civic information consumption and targeted advertising. My aim is to inform the design of algorithmic systems that are more transparent, equitable, and accountable to their users.</p> <br/> 
      <p>Prior to Penn, I spent three years working in industry as a software engineer at Sisu Data and Apple. I earned an MS in <a href="https://www.cs.stanford.edu/">Computer Science</a> and a BS in <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu/">Symbolic Systems</a> from Stanford University. My work has been generously supported by an <a href="https://blog.seas.upenn.edu/penn-engineering-ph-d-students-receive-funding-from-amazon-to-advance-trustworthy-ai/">AWS gift for research in Trustworthy AI</a>.</p>
